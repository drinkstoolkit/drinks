DRINKS Toolkit is a collection of web-based widget powered with HTML5 Canvas API and Javascript, designed to make easily and fast development on webpages. 
In this first release we have developed a toolkit based to realize web instruments, but in the future DRINKS, will be more than a toolkit. We want to create many others instruments, realize hardware to control everything, provide support, and useful features to make your work faster and easier and create web widgets that can improve your web development.
Using just one tag you can manipulate a more complex javascript interface taking advantage of the power of HTML, so you can create your instrument using Drinks API, bind it to a tag and include it to your web pages easily. 
Drinks is distributed under new BSD license and you can download the Open Pack for free or donating something that we'll use to improve Drinks. In other way, you can help us only downloading the package and giving us your positive feedback, this will be a personal satisfaction and it will pay so much work made to realize this project.
